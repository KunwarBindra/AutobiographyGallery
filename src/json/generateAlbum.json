My father ordered thick burgers and crispy fries, his broad shoulders and graying hair giving him a comforting presence. My mother, in a simple blue dress, glanced lovingly at my younger sister, Lucy, who was bubbling with joy, eagerly waiting for her food. The jukebox played softly in the background, filled with the nostalgic sounds of country tunes, while outside, the bright blue sky hinted at more adventures ahead.",
